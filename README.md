# ChemSpell

Spell any word (that is possible) using the symbols of the elements of the Periodic Table.
I also used my algorithm to see how many words in the English and Spanish languages can be spelled using the periodic table. You can try your language by
downloading the repo and feeding the code a frequency list of your language. For more info click [here](analysis/README.md).
